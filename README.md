# Diabetes-Prediction

Diabetes Prediction by using Machine Learning


Project Overview

This project applies Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict Diabetes based on medical attributes such as age, insulin, pregnancies, BMI and other health indicators. 
The model is trained using supervised machine learning algorithms.
The same model was deployed with Streamlit for an interactive web application, the Multi-Disease Prediction Project.

Features

Machine learning model(Support Vector Machine) trained on a diabetes dataset.
To save the trained model, "pickle" was used.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease dataset.
